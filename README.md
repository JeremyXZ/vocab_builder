## Purpose and functionalities of Vocab-builder (not suitable for mobile site)

Vocab-builder aims to provide a tool for you,  an English language learner to build your English vocabulary in CONTEXT. 
In a few clicks, you will create a fill-in-the-blank quiz with clues provided, a list of new words you selected 
and the orginal article, as well as a flash card that can test  your familiarity with those new words.

Whenever you find an interesting article online, you can copy and paste it into the input box. Anywhere you
come across a new word/phrase in the text, you can just highlight it and the word will be shown in the word list. You
can add a definition or synonym next to the word (must use a colon ":" in front of the definition). 

To create a quiz: click 'Create test' buttton, and another editable box will appear,  showing a clue list 
(consisting of randomly reshuffled new words) and the same article,but with all of the new words replaced by 
parentheses in blue color.

To do the quiz:  just write the word/phrase in the blanks inside those parentheses while refering to the clues.

To check the result of the quiz: click 'Check test' button, the orginal text will re-appear on top of the completed quiz
for you to compare the results. 

To save both the original article and the generated word list in html format to your computer: click 'Save text'
button and type the file name.

To load the original article and the word list back to the input box: click "Load Text" button and select the proper file
from  computer. This will allow you to re-take the quiz (i.e. highlight words in the artcile as per the word list, delete 
the word list and click "Create Test" button). 

To save the word list in text format: click "Save Word List" button. This word list can be loaded into the Flash card.

To use the flash card, click "Flash card", which will show a flash card interface

To load the word list file into the flash card: click "Choose file", select the list (and click "open" on your file system)
and click "Load Word List". 


To load questions and check if the word list is properly loaded, click the "LOAD QUESTIONS" bar.

2) To reveal an definition, click on the light-blue question area. Each word in the word list will be shown randomly twice. 

3) Next word will appear when clicking "✅ " or "❌ ".  The former confirms you've known the word, and the latter means the opposite. 

4) In the stats section at the bottome right corner of the card, there are three digits, respectively indicating the number
 of "new words", "known words" and  "familiar words".  Clicking "✅ " on a new word for the first time will turn it into a 
 "known word", for the second time into a "familiar word". Clicking "❌ " will do the opposite.
